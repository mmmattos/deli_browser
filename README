README

This is a Chrome extension for browsing publicly available bookmars on Delicious
boorkmarking service. Browse can be done by account and tag.

Account is set in the Options page. 
Tags can be combined with the plus sign. For instance, to search for bookmarks
that have both the tag "movie" and "comedy", you need to specify "movie+comedy" 
in the tag search field.

This repository holds the result of my first inmersion into chrome extensions
developmente combined with the exploration of a REST API using JSON, javascript
and JQuery, to which, Delicious serves as great playground.

It can be easily customized to any other REST services.

In this first release, no authentication will be required since its purpose is to
browse publicly available content.
